The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results when dealing with percentages and lengths that have different units. For instance, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not work as expected in all browsers if the parent element's width is not accurately determined. This is because `calc()` performs unit conversions during runtime and inconsistencies might emerge due to rounding errors or browser-specific interpretations.
Another subtle issue is using `calc()` with `max-width` or `min-width` properties and complex calculations.  It can cause layout unpredictability, especially on resizing or when combining multiple `calc()` expressions within nested elements.
